This project hosts the code for our **CVPR 2017** paper.

- Cesc Chunseong Park, Byeongchang Kim and Gunhee Kim. *Attend to You*: Personalized Image Captioning with Context Sequence Memory Networks. In *CVPR*, 2017. (**Spotlight**) [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06485)

We address personalization issues of image captioning, which have not been discussed yet in previous research.
For a query image, we aim to generate a descriptive sentence, accounting for prior knowledge such as the user's active vocabularies in previous documents.
As applications of personalized image captioning, we tackle two post automation tasks: hashtag prediction and post generation, on our newly collected Instagram dataset, consisting of 1.1M posts from 6.3K users.
We propose a novel captioning model named Context Sequence Memory Network (CSMN).

## Reference

## UPDATE BY JAY
add an API to run your own image to hashtag and captions

```
# modify image path in img2txt.sh
./img2txt
```

## Running Code

### Get our code

## *InstaPIC-1.1M* Dataset

*InstaPIC-1.1M* is our newly collected Instagram dataset, where PIC denotes Personalized Image Captioning.

For dataset collection, we select 270 search keywords by gathering the 10 most common hashtags for each of the following 27 generated categories of Pinterest: celebrities, design, education, food, drink, gardening, hair, health, fitness, history, humor, decor, outdoor, illustration, quotes, product, sports, technology, travel, wedding, tour, car, football, animal, pet, fashion and worldcup.

Key statistics of *InstaPIC-1.1M* dataset are outlined below.
We also show average and median (in parentheses) values.
The total unique posts and users in our dataset are (1,124,815/6,315)

| Dataset       | #posts        | #users        | #posts/user | #words/post |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| caption       | 721,176       | 4,820         | 149.6 (118) | 8.55 (8)    |
| hashtag       | 518,116       | 3,633         | 142.6 (107) | 7.45 (7)    |

If you download and uncompress the dataset correctly, structure of dataset will follow the below structure.

```
{project_root}/data
├── json
│   ├── insta-caption-train.json
│   ├── insta-caption-test1.json
│   ├── insta-caption-test2.json
│   ├── insta-hashtag-train.json
│   ├── insta-hashtag-test1.json
│   └── insta-hashtag-test2.json
└── images
    ├── {user1_id}_@_{post1_id}
    ├── {user1_id}_@_{post2_id}
    ├── {user2_id}_@_{post1_id}
    └── ...
```

We provide two types of test set, test1 and test2.
Test1 is generated by split whole dataset by user, which means user contexts shown in this test set does not appear in training phase.
Test2 is generated by split whole dataset by posts, which means user context shown in this test set can be appear in training phase.
Since we do not provide validation set, we highly recommend you to split validation set from training set.

## Examples

Here are post generation examples:
